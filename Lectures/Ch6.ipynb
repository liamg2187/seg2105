    "## Introduction to Patterns\n",
    "- The recurring aspects of designs are called *design patterns*.\n",
    "- A *pattern* is the outline of a reusable solution to a general problem encountered in a particular context.\n",
    "- Many of them have been systematically documented for all software developers to use.\n",
    "- A good pattern should:\n",
    "    - Be as general as possible.\n",
    "    - Contain a solution that has been proven to effectively solve the problem in the indicated context.\n",
    "- Studying patterns is an effective way to learn from the experience of others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern Description\n",
    "- Context: the general situation in which the pattern applies.\n",
    "- Problem: a short sentence or two raising the main difficulty.\n",
    "- Forces: the issues or concerns to consider when solving the problem."
