    "## Introduction to Patterns\n",
    "- The recurring aspects of designs are called *design patterns*.\n",
    "- A *pattern* is the outline of a reusable solution to a general problem encountered in a particular context.\n",
    "- Many of them have been systematically documented for all software developers to use.\n",
    "- A good pattern should:\n",
    "    - Be as general as possible.\n",
    "    - Contain a solution that has been proven to effectively solve the problem in the indicated context.\n",
    "- Studying patterns is an effective way to learn from the experience of others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern Description\n",
    "- Context: the general situation in which the pattern applies.\n",
    "- Problem: a short sentence or two raising the main difficulty.\n",
    "- Forces: the issues or concerns to consider when solving the problem.\n",
    "- Solution: The recommended way to solve the problem in the given context.\n",
    "- Antipatterns (optional): Solutions that are inferior or do not work in this context.\n",
    "- Related patterns (optional): Patterns that are similar to this pattern.\n",
    "- References: Who developed or inspired the pattern."

    "- *Context*:\n",
    "    - Often in a domain model you find a set of related objects (*occurences*).\n",

    "    - What is the best way to represent such sets of occurences in a class diagram?\n",

    "- *Problem*:\n",
    "    - How do you best model players and roles so that a player can change roles or possess multiple roles?\n",
    "- *Forces*:\n",
    "    - It is desirable to improve encapsulation by capturing the information associated with each separate role in a class.\n",
