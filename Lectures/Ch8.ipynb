    "## Interaction Diagrams\n",
    "- Interaction diagrams are used to model the dynamic aspects of a software system.\n",
    "- They help you to visualize how the system runs.\n",
    "- An interaction diagram is often build from a use case and a class diagram.\n",
    "- The objective is to show how a set of objects accomplish the required interactions with an actor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Elements in Interaction Diagrams\n",
    "- Instances of classes\n",
    "    - Shown as boxes with the class and object identifier underlined.\n",
    "- Actors\n",
    "    - Use the stick-person symbol as in use case diagrams.\n",
    "- Messages\n",
    "    - Shown as arrows from actor to object, or from object to object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sequence Diagrams\n",
    "- A sequence diagram shows the sequence of messages exchanged by the set of objects performing a certain task.\n",
    "- The objects are arranged horizontally.\n",
    "- An *actor* that initiates the interaction is often shown on the left.\n",
    "- The vertical dimension represents time.\n",
    "- A vertical line, called a *lifeline*, is attached to each object or actor.\n",
    "- The lifeline becomes a broad box, called an *activation box* during the *live activation* period.\n",
    "- A message is represented as an arrow between activation boxes of the sender and receiver.\n",
    "    - A message is labelled and can have an argument list and a return value.\n",

    "- Special case of alt.\n",
    "- Equivalent to an alt with two operands.\n",

    "## State Machine Diagrams\n",
    "- A state diagram describes the behaviour of a system, some part of a system, or an individual object.\n",
    "- At any given point in time, the system or object is in a certain state.\n",
    "    - Being in a state means that it will behave in a specific way in response to any events that occur.\n",
    "- Some event will cause the system to change state.\n",
    "    - In the new state, the system will behave in a different way to events.\n",

    "- At any given point in time, the system is in one state.\n",
    "- It will remain in this state until an event occurs that causes it to change state.\n",
    "- A state is represented by a rounded rectangle containing the name of the state.\n",
    "- Special states:\n",
    "    - A black circle represents the *start state*.\n",
    "    - A circle with a ring around it represents an *end state*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transitions\n",
    "- A transition represents a change of state in response to an event.\n",
    "    - It is considered to occur instantaneously.\n",
    "- The label on each transition is the event that causes the change of state.\n",
