    "## Domain Analysis\n",
    "- The process by which a software engineer learns about the domain to better understand the problem:\n",
    "    - The *domain* is the general field of business or technology in which the clients will use the software.\n",
    "    - A *domian expert* is a person who has a deep knowledge of the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Domain Analysis Document\n",
    "- Best put on a website (e.g. a wiki) as a descriptive test and diagrams with links to relevant information.\n",

    "## Types of Requirements\n",
    "- Functional requirements\n",
    "    - Describe *what* the system should do.\n",
    "    - Ex. accepted inputs and outputs, what data should be stored, what computations should be performed, timing and synchronization, etc.\n",
    "- Non-functional requirements\n",
    "    - Process requirements: *contraints* on the project plan and development methods.\n",
    "    - Quality requirements: *constraints* on the design to meet specified levels of quality.\n",

    "## Use Cases\n",
    "- A *use case* is a typical sequence of actions that a user performs in order to complete a given task.\n",
    "- The objective *use case analysis* is to model the system from the point of view of how users interact with this system when trying to achieve their objectives.\n",
    "- A *use case model* consists of\n",
    "    - A set of use cases\n",
    "    - An optional description or diagram indicating how they are related.\n",
    "- A use case should:\n",
    "    - Cover a *sequence of steps*.\n",
    "    - Describe the *user's interaction* with the system - **not** the computations the system performs.\n",
    "    - Be as *independent* as possible from any particular user interface design.\n",
    "    - Only include actions in which the actor interacts with the computer - **not** actions a user does manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to describe a single use case\n",
    "1. **Name**: Short and descriptive.\n",
    "2. **Actors**: Types of users that will do this.\n",
    "3. **Goals**: What are the actors trying to achieve.\n",
    "4. **Preconditions**: State of the system before the use case.\n",

    "- Keep the description of the basic use case simple.\n",

    "### Generalizations\n",
    "- Much like superclasses in a class diagram.\n",
    "- A generalized use case represents *several similar* use cases.\n",
    "- One or more specializations provides details of the similar use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inclusions\n",
    "- Allow one to express *commonality* between several different use cases.\n",
    "- Are included in other use cases.\n",
    "    - Even very different use cases can share sequence of actions.\n",
    "    - Enable you to avoid repeating details in multiple use cases.\n",
    "- Represent the performing of a *lower-level task* with a lower-level goal.\n",

    "- Observation\n",
    "    Read documents and discuss requirements with users.\n",
    "    - Shadowing important potential users as they do their work.\n",
    "    - Session videotaping.\n",
    "- Interviewing\n",
    "    - Ask about specific details.\n",
    "    - Ask about the stakeholder's vision for the future.\n",
    "    - Ask if they have alternative ideas.\n",
    "    - Ask for other sources of information.\n",
    "    - Ask them to draw diagrams.\n",
    "- Brainstorming\n",
    "    - Appoint an experienced moderator.\n",
    "    - Arrange the attendees around a table.\n",
    "    - Decide on a 'trigger question'.\n",
    "    - Ask each participant to write an answer and pass the paper to its neighbour.\n",
    "- Prototyping\n",
    "    - The simplest king: *paper prototype*.\n",
    "        - A set of pictures of the system that are shown to users in sequence to explain what would happen.\n",
    "    - The most common: a mock-up of the system's UI.\n",
    "        - Written in a rapid prototyping language.\n",
    "        - Does *not* normally perform any computations, access any databases, or interact with any other systems.\n",
    "        - May prototype a particular aspect of the system.\n",
    "- Use case analysis\n",
    "    - Determine the classes of users that will use the facilities of this system (actors).\n",
    "    - Determine the tasks that each actor will need to do with the system."
