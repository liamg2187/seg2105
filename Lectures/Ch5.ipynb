    "# Chapter 5 - Modelling with Classes\n",
    "## What is UML\n",
    "- The Unified Modelling Language is a standard graphical language for modelling object oriented software.\n",
    "\n",
    "## UML Diagrams\n",
    "- Class diagrams\n",
    "    - describe **classes** and their **relationships**.\n",
    "- Interaction diagrams\n",
    "    - Sequence and communication diagrams.\n",
    "    - Show the **behaviour** of systems in terms of how objects **interact** with each other.\n",
    "- State diagrams and activity diagrams\n",
    "    - show how systems or classes **behave internally**.\n",
    "- Component and deployment diagrams\n",
    "    - show how the various components of systems are **arranged logically and physically**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Essentials of UML Class Diagrams\n",
    "***The main symbols shown on class diagrams are:***\n",
    "- *Classes*: represent the types of data themselves.\n",
    "- *Associations*: represent linkages between instances of classes.\n",
    "- *Attributes*: are simple data found in classes and their instances.\n",
    "- *Operations*: represent the *abstract* functions performed by the classes and their instances, as well as specific methods implementing these.\n",
    "- *Generalizations*: group classes into inheritance hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes\n",
    "**A class is simply represented as a box with the name of the class inside.**\n",
    "- The diagram may also show the attributes and operations.\n",
    "- The complete signature of an operation is: `operationName(parameterName: parameterType ...): returnType`\n",
    "\n",
    "![UML Classes Examples](../Resources/UMLClasses.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Associations and Multiplicity\n",
    "**An *association* is used to show how two classes are related to each other**\n",
    "- Symbols indicating *multiplicity* are shown at each end of the association.\n",
    "- Associations are by default *bi-directional*.\n",
    "- It is possible to limit the direction of an association by adding an arrow at one end.\n",
    "\n",
    "![UML Associations Examples](../Resources/UMLAssociations.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each association can be labelled, to make explicit the nature of the asscciation.\n",
    "- Multiplicities:\n",
    "    - Constant (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.)\n",
    "    - Range (1...4, 0...*, etc.)\n",
    "    - Many (*)\n",
    "- Avoid unnecessary one-to-one associations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Association Classes\n",
    "- Sometimes, an attribute that concerns two associated classes cannot be placed in either of the classes.\n",
    "- The following are equivalent:\n",
    "\n",
    "![UML Association Classes Example](../Resources/UMLAssociationClasses.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflexive Associations\n",
    "- It is possible for an association to connect a class to itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "![UML Reflexive Association Example](../Resources/UMLReflexiveAssociation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reflexive associations can be asymmetrical or symmetrical:\n",
    "    - Asymmetrical associations are associations that are not identical between 2 objects that are associated to one another (e.g., a course has certain prerequisites and successors, but those prerequisites and successors won't have the same prerequisites and successors). Asymmetrical associations use 2 variables.\n",
    "    - Symmetrical relations are associations that are identical between two associated objects (e.g. if a user is friends with someone, that someone is also friends with them). Symmetrical relations use 1 variable."

    "### Generalization\n",
    "**Specializing a superclass into two or more subclasses**\n",
    "- A *generalization set* is a labeled group of generalizations with a common superclass.\n",
    "- The label (sometimes called the *discriminator*) describes the criteria used in the specialization.\n",

    "### Object Diagrams\n",
    "- In order to create an object diagram, you have to first start with a class diagram.\n",
    "- A *link* is an instance of an association in the same way that we say an object is an instance of a class.\n",

    "- <Name of variable>: <Name of class> (all underlined)\n",

    "    - When you show an instance diagram generated from a class diagram, there will be an instance of *both* classes joined by an association.\n",
    "- Generalizations describe relationships between *classes* in class diagrams.\n",
    "    - They do not appear in instance diagrams at all.\n",
    "    - An instance of any class should also be considered to be an instance of each of that class' superclasses."

    "- Aggregations are special associations that represent 'part-whole' relationships.\n",
    "    - The 'whole' side is often called the *assembly* or the *aggregate*.\n",
    "    - This symbol is a shorthand notation association named isPartOf.\n",

    "![Aggregation Example](../Resources/AggregationExample.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- As a general rule, you can mark an association as an aggregation if the following are true:\n",
    "    - You can state that the parts 'are part of' the aggregate or the aggregate 'is composed of' the parts.\n",
    "    - When something owns or controls the aggregate, then they also own or control the parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Composition\n",
    "- A *composition* is a strong kind of aggregation.\n",
    "- If the aggregate is destroyed, then the parts are destroyed as well.\n",

    "### Propagation\n",
    "- A mechanism where an operation in an aggregate is implemented by having the aggregate perform that operation on its parts.\n",
    "- At the same time, properties of the parts are often propagated back to the aggregate.\n",
    "- Propagation is to aggregation as inheritance is to generalization. The major difference is:\n",
    "    - Inheritance is an implicit mechanism.\n",
    "    - Propagation has to be programmed when required."

    "- A constraint cannot have any side-effects.\n",
    "    - It cannot compute a non-boolean result nor modify any data.\n",
    "- OCL statements in class diagrams can specify what the values of attributes and associations must be.\n",
    "- OCL statements can be built from:\n",
    "    - References to role names, association names, attributes and the results of operations.\n",
    "    - The logical values `true` and `false`.\n",

    "- If C has a one-to-many association called assoc to another class D,\n",
    "    - Then self.assoc evaluates to a Set whose elements are of type D.\n",
    "    - If assoc is {ordered} then a Sequence results.\n",
